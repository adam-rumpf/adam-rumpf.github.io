	<p><i>This is a work in progress. Check back soon!</i></p>
	
	<!-- JS random name generation (also link to Slight Misspeller as a random word generation project), have been accruing lists of amusing words for years and it's finally paid off (Mom), also have specially-made lists of RPG character names and name elements, and have been working on random dumb name generation for a game project I've had in the works for a while; also something that I constantly added to over the course of development, just keeping a notepad on my desk to write down any funny words that came to mind during development -->
	
	<!-- original idea for action-focused entirely about genetic algorithms, love of RPG aesthetics and the Discworld characterization of wizards; link to cellular_automata.html -->
	
	<!-- pivot away from the original genetic algorithm idea (with I will probably revisit in more of a focused game) in order to focus on just one interesting thing with this one; original grid graph plan and having to abandon it for computational expense, kind of okay in this context since most of the enemies aren't really supposed to be that smart -->
	
	<!-- move from grid graph to dynamic A* generation with implicit graph generation; graph could potentially save time but has a lot of overhead, especially in GMS2, and in practice an enemy will only really need to consider a sparse portion of the overall grid anyways; implicit grid in A* means repeating the same work over and over, but it can get away with far fewer memory structures -->
	
	<!-- importance of preparation and setting up and somewhat optimizing systems (find the Donald Knuth quote about premature optimization being dangerous); very little visible progress for first 3 days but made it really easy to add content later on -->
	
	<!-- the fact that enemies calculate graph distances with Chebyshev distance makes them make some unusual-looking moves, which I kind of like; in Chebyshev distance it's still a shortest path, but it makes them more unpredictable for the player -->
	
	<!-- getting game to speed up with Chebyshev distance and fast enemy pathfinding and moves -->
	
	<!-- Mention how much I like the game Magicka, and its inclusion of magic as being super intricate, super powerful, but also super unpredictable and sometimes as dangerous to yourself as it is to enemies. -->
	
	<!-- As of the end of the competition the game is in quite a minimal and incomplete state, and is really little more than a tech demo. However I've made extensive use of object inheritance, so adding content (in the form of new enemies, items, and rooms) should actually be pretty easy, and I intend to add more to the game to make it into a full experience. -->
	
	<!-- Lots and lots of errors related to trying to maintain a bunch of different data structures with different information about different game objects for use in quickly calculating updates. It's efficient if you can do it right, but it's also quite easily for them to get out-of-sync, especially considering how complicated a turn can get. -->
	
	<!-- Significant change from the structure, RPG-like spells to more of a random, classical, and unpredictable CA model. Turns out to be more in line with the Magicka idea. Less gamelike, but also funny. -->
	
	<!-- Massively simplified the work by changing from spell objects to a global grid, sometimes the simpler and more obvious approach is actually better, and in this case it also led to more interesting gameplay -->
	
	<!-- Let's call it a prototype. Yes, that makes it sound like not a failure. -->
	
	<!-- Most of the development time went to essentially making a board game system. There were a lot of false starts (like having to redo the pathfinding system) which caused me to lose ~2 days, and even 3/4 of the way through the jam I had essentially no "game" to show for it. -->
	
	<!-- Decided to ship a standalone version of the wizard name generation rather than include a half-baked version of the actual game. -->
