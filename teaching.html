	<p class="temp">list a few specific classes that I would like to teach and ideas for how to teach them: calc, graph theory, optimization, computational math, algorithms, mathematical modeling, intro to profession, lin alg, diff eq, dynamical systems</p>
	
	<p class="temp">courses that I would like to create: undergrad game theory, network flows, undergrad OR</p>
	
	<p class="quote">What if at school you had to take an 'art class' in which you were only taught how to paint a fence? What if you were never shown the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci and Picasso? Would that make you appreciate art? Would you want to learn more about it?  I doubt it. You would probably say something like this: 'Learning art at school was a waste of my time. If I ever need to have my fence painted, I'll just hire people to do this for me.' Of course, this sounds ridiculous, but this is how math is taught, and so in the eyes of most of us it becomes the equivalent of watching paint dry. While the paintings of the great masters are readily available, the math of the great masters is locked away. — Edward Frenkel, <a href="https://www.edwardfrenkel.com/lovemath/" target="_blank">Love and Math</a></p>
	
	<p class="temp">interested in helping out with outreach and summer programs and clubs, was in an accelerated math program in high school and know how important it can be for students to have that kind of opportunity; also helps to try to solve math education problems as early as possible since they start well before college</p>
	
	<p class="temp">mission statement and life goal, cite sources about prevalence of math hatred (mystifies mathematicians because they were the ones who had enough patience to make it through to the good part, frontloaded with the worst stuff that loses students, mathematicians know about the study of patterns and know that there's a bunch of really cool stuff like high dimension and chaos and the ability to model anything in the physical world; I myself joined math for purely pragmatic reasons and didn't really know that I was interested in it until later, and I should never have had to wait that long) (common for mathematicians to think of math as puzzles and games, but to students it has never been anything but a chore and the courses never give them any reason to see it as anything more, do not impress upon students what a broad and varied field math is), unique position and skills to really help in this one area; refer to CV page for more formal info, not entirely sense of duty (truly enjoy teaching, presenting things that interest me, coming up with demonstrations, Programs tab should attest to the fact that I like making demonstrations as a hobby)</p>
	
	<p class="temp">teaching style (Socratic, use of technology, focusing mostly on projects and then homework and finally exams [which way too many teachers focus on], calling random students to throw out ideas, no such thing as a wrong answer when we're developing the ideas, focus on building life skills [writing, arguing, spotting illogical arguments]), strengths (embrace technology [the world we live in, Wolfram Alpha, should have set us free like calculators do, trope of mathematicians being bad at mental arithmetic and accounting and such because those are things that they never have to do by hand thanks to computers, still important to go through processes by hand once but not to do drill after drill], as much as possible tailor experiences for students [variable assignments {make sure that this does not sound like elitism or meritocracy, and mention that there is precedent since some professors allow their students to skip cumulative finals if they already have an A}, take suggestions from students to see what they would like to hear about], project-based, hands-on, genuine examples and upfront about what is a toy problem [honesty], stop and smell the roses, punk rock, break up period rather than just lecturing [related to changing up techniques and trying to cover all learning styles], focus on modeling [great for concrete applications and life skills and an excuse to introduce a lot of other math; think that it and graph theory should be early requirements]; look at my interview notes to see some of the points that I wanted to hit)</p>
