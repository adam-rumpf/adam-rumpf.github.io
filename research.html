Mention that I will try to link to a PDF version of the paper for all of my published work, and that I am posting the associated computer code to <a href="https://github.com/adam-rumpf" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

	<!-- Interests -->
	
	<h1 id="interests">Research Interests</h1>
	
	<p class="temp">The research interests posted here should be extremely brief (~1 paragraph). Write more about specific ideas in the actual research statement, which should be linked to both here and on the CV page.</p>
	
	<p class="temp">General topics for which I have some interest and experience: math education, linear optimization, OR, graph theory, network flows, dynamical systems, civil infrastructure planning, mathematical modeling, mathematical biology, population ecology, epidemiology</p>
	
	<p class="temp">Particular topics of interest: optimal control for epidemiology (OR and epidemiology), network epidemiology (graph theory and epidemiology; possibly extend the bacteria pipe problem), transit assignment models (describe why this is a bigger issue for public transit than road network, which can both be modeled using similar latency functions but that modeling assumption is far more valid for road network than public transit) (current situation is really not ideal, way too hard to strictly enforce capacity in an efficient way, existing methods introduce failure chance which is really just an arbitrary penalty rather than a real increase in waiting time; no accounting for boarding order), disaster recovery planning (unknown time horizon is an issue; packet-based scheduling techniques could work but are very expensive; path-based could also work but is intractable), graph decomposition problems (lin opt and graph theory, similar to P1 work), transportation engineering for environmental objectives (often cited as a lacking area of research), interdependent network studies (finding vulnerabilities, uses for both civil infrastructure engineering and epidemiology), spectral graph theory (lin opt, lin alg, network flows, Markov chains, so similar to both P1 and P2), possibly experimental teaching techniques (ask Dr. K. whether that should be included here; would need some specific ideas), disaster relief models that are either quickly solvable or able to be updated with new information mid-execution (ant colony does this), complex systems (Adilson Motter), stochastic and robust optimization (possibly applied to epidemiology), network interdependency model with causality (might be related to temporal networks), evaluation-minimizing black box optimization for discrete problems (similar to idea of RBF method except that this only works for continuous; may be able to build it into a modified local search or genetic algorithm or something; idea is to mix likely good solutions with far-flung solutions to feel out the space), clustering problems with constraints (like certain points being forced to either be in the same group or not, or giving different points different weights for the purposes of evaluating the sum of squared errors, applications in clustering public transit networks since it allows us to weigh high-traffic areas more)</p>

	<p>The following unpublished reports are mostly taken from my personal notes, but hopefully someone may find them useful. Most of them are either basic overviews or specific technique explanations for concepts from operations research.</p>

			<p>A. Rumpf. Introduction to Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search. Technical report, 2019.</p>
			
			<p class="tab">Links: <a href="documents/sa_ts_intro.pdf" download="sa_ts_intro.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a></p>
			
			<p>This is a brief introduction to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing" target="_blank">simulated annealing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_search" target="_blank">tabu search</a> metaheuristics. I wrote these notes in preparation for my second major research project, which involved solving a difficult combinatorial optimization problem with a hybrid simulated annealing/tabu search algorithm.</p>

			<p>A. Rumpf. Introduction to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) Conditions. Technical report, 2018.</p>

			<p>I wrote these notes for myself while studying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilevel_optimization" target="_blank">bilevel programs</a> that came out of several of my Ph.D. research projects, since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions" target="_blank">KKT conditions</a> can be used to rewrite the lower-level program as a set of algebraic constraints in the upper-level program. They are an important concept in nonlinear optimization, and hopefully these notes will provide a brief introduction. The linked Mathematica files were written in conjunction with these notes, and provide some useful pictures to go along with them.</p>

			<p class="tab">Links: <a href="documents/logical_ip_formulation.pdf" download="logical_ip_formulation.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a></p>
			
			<p>These are some techniques that I've written up for expressing logical constraints (of forms like "if constraint 1 is true, then constraint 2 must be true") as integer program constraints. I have used these types of techniques extensively in the process of using mixed integer-linear program models of decision problems.</p>

			<p>I wrote this guide for myself while first getting <a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer" target="_blank">CPLEX</a> set up on my computer for use in my linear optimization projects. It is a complicated enough process that I had to spend many hours searching through forums and blogs to figure it out. Hopefully this can save someone some time.</p>
