	<p>A Python module that generates slightly misspelled versions of text files.</p>
	
	<p>Two different types of misspelling procedures are defined. <a href="programs/sligtmisseplle.html"><i>Typographical</i></a> misspelling is based on common mistakes from sloppy typing on a QWERTY keyboard. <a href="programs/slish_misspeelter.html"><i>Phonological</i></a> misspelling is based on some rudimentary and lazy English <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonotactics">phonotactics</a> and is meant to yield a pronounceable result rather than simply a string of random characters. The alterations are also meant to be minor enough for the text to remain vaguely understandable.</p>
	
	<p>What is the purpose of this module? That is an excellent question.</p>
	
	<h2>Motivation</h2>
	
	<p>My high school senior prank was to turn literally every wall fixture upside-down: Every poster, every banner, every framed picture, every bulletin board notice. Everything. I snuck into the building after hours with a small group of friends, and after a couple hours of work the deed was done. By far my favorite element was the paper dolls from some sort of charity drive that was going on. Every donor got to sign a paper doll to be posted on the wall, and by the end of the drive there were hundreds of them, filling an entire wall in the hallway. Fortunately for us they were only taped up, and so we were able to turn every single one of them upside-down.</p>
	
	<p>This might not strike you as the most memorable of senior pranks, but it's exactly my favorite kind of practical joke: One which is slightly surrealistic and easily overlooked, but when you finally notice it you begin to gradually realize just how much work someone must have put into it. So the first answer to the question "Why would you spend so much time making such a dumb and useless thing?" is that it's my idea of comedy.</p>
	
	<p>The second answer is the same as my answer for why I do anything: It was something that I was already thinking about for my <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/"><i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i></a> campaign. I do like the simplicity of the magic system in D&amp;D, but for a long time I've been toying with the idea of developing a custom magic system that would allow the players to create their own spells by combining magic words in the correct way. I would want my system to be intricate and precise so that writing a spell is like writing a computer program, leaving absolutely no ambiguity as to the effects of a spell, but I would also want it to be something that follows linguistic rules.</p>
	
	<p>A lot of fans of the fantasy genre are very interested in linguistics. <a href="https://www.tolkiensociety.org/author/biography/">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> famously invented fantasy languages for worldbuilding and fun, and a lot of DMs do the same for use in their campaigns. I have a minor interest in linguistics and in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLduA6tsl3gygfiWmGAhhHb4-HAqP6I63l">conlang</a> (<b>con</b>structed <b>lang</b>uage) community, stemming from my own efforts to develop an language-based magic system. Because of this I've thought more than the average person about how exactly to break words into their component parts and how to build them back up from a set of phonotactic rules, and this led me to ask myself what the phonological equivalent of a "typo" would be.</p>
	
	<h2>Misspelling Procedures</h2>
	
	<p>It would be trivially simple to write a program that just randomizes a portion of the characters in a text file, but that wasn't nearly convoluted enough for my taste. More importantly it didn't seem like it was likely to lead to funny-sounding typos, which was the entire point of this project in the first place. This is what prompted me to first consider the idea of how to algorithmically mistype a word in a way that would leave a pronounceable result, and to the concept of phonological misspelling. Typographical misspelling came later for the sake of completeness.</p>
	
	<h3>Typographical Misspelling</h3>
	
	<p>What I've termed <a href="programs/sligtmisseplle.html">"typographical misspelling"</a> is what most people mean when they refer to misspelling in typed text: That an error was made during typing so that the wrong sequence of characters is produced. In particular this might include deleted characters, inserted extraneous characters, incorrect characters, or transposed characters.</p>
	
	<p>Rather than generating these types of errors completely at random, I wanted my program to roughly model the sorts of mistakes that someone might make when they have a bad case of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjbgeGhn_Lg">"stupid fingers"</a>, in which case it would make sense for any erroneous characters to be close to the intended character on the keyboard. The solution I came up with was to randomly draw inserted and replaced characters from the pool of keys adjacent to the intended one on a QWERTY keyboard, weighted according to their Euclidean distance from the intended key.</p>
	
	<p>Here's an example of the sorts of errors produced by typographical misspelling:</p>

	<h3>Phonological Misspelling</h3>
	
	<p>What I've termed <a href="programs/slish_misspeelter.html">"phonological misspelling"</a> is essentially the equivalent of typographical misspelling, but with alterations made directly to the sounds of the word rather than the characters, themselves. At least, that's the idealized definition. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYNzqgU7na4">English is not a phonetic language</a>, so </p>
	
	<!--
	-How I came up with the solution for how to accomplish different types of misspelling.
	"Typographical" misspelling is the standard type of spelling error, where some letters are deleted, inserted, or changed essentially at random. "stupid fingers" <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjbgeGhn_Lg>
	-"Phonological" misspelling, under ideal circumstances, would be the same thing but with the IPA spelling of the word, meaning that *sounds* are misplaced (deleted, inserted, or changed) but in a way that still follows English phonotactic rules. English is not a phonetic language, though, so I can't get the pronunciation directly from the spelling, and as a result my program has to work based on how English words are traditionally spelled rather than how they are pronounced.
	-(As an illustration of this, take a sample word, show some typographical misspellings, and then show some idealized phonological misspellings based on its IPA spelling, and finally show how my program attempts to approximate those effects.)

	<h2>Development Notes</h2>

	<!--
	-Typographical errors simulate typing errors, adjacent keys, probability proportional to L2-distance.
	-General process for defining pronouncable words, roughly since it's based on English spelling rather than phonetic spelling. As a result the rules that we end up with are something of a mishmash between the real English phonotactics and some typographical simplifications, since there isn't exactly a one-to-one correspondence between spelling and pronunciation.
	-Simplification to go with (C)V(C) sets, and to treat the first (C) group separately.
	-Logic of the list of allowed onsets. This involved making a table of letter and consonant blend pairs and marking explicitly which ones to allow, based partly on what exists in English and partly on what seems like it would be pronouncable. Ideally we could define this set using some simple set operations rather than having to explicitly name them all.
