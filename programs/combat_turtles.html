	<p>This is a <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> module for programming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(robot)">turtle robots</a> to compete against each other in arena combat. See the online documentation <a href="https://adam-rumpf.github.io/combat-turtles/">here</a> for a complete guide.</p>
	
	<p><i>Combat Turtles</i> is meant as a learning tool for intermediate-level Python students. It defines a combat game in which programmable turtle robots move around a battlefield firing missiles to destroy each other. A parent class, <code>TurtleParent</code>, defines a variety of basic attributes and methods for these turtle robots, and an <code>ai/</code> folder contains a variety of subclasses of this parent class which define different turtle AIs. The main driver script <code>combatturtles.py</code> loads selected AI subclasses to compete against each other in combat.</p>
	
	<p>The player can create their own turtle AIs by extending the <code>TurtleParent</code> class and overwriting a few key methods. The game is run using discrete step events (at a rate of approximately 30 steps/second), with each turtle defining its actions on a per-step basis. Custom AI submodules (in the form of standalone <code>.py</code> files) can be added to the </code>ai/</code> directory to import the player's AI into the game. Several example and template subclasses are included in this directory to get the player started. Python students might enjoy competing against each other to see whom can come up with the best AI, while Python instructors might consider running a class tournament to encourage students to learn more about object-oriented programming.</p>
	
	<h2>Background</h2>
	
	<p>When I was but a mere larval game developer, I stumbled upon a game which was meant as an educational tool to get students interested in programming and AI design. It was an arena combat game in which two robots could move around and shoot projectiles at each other, and the player could write their own AI script to determine each robot's behavior. Then I swiftly forgot about it before actually bothering to write any AI scripts. (I also don't remember what the game is and have been unable to find it since. I want to say that it was developed in <a href="http://www.3dgamestudio.com/">3D Game Studio</a>? Boy, I'm a great raconteur.) But apparently some aspect of the project has haunted my brain for all these years, and I've wanted to make something like it since I started teaching computer science.</p>
	
	<p>I've had the opportunity to teach a few Python classes, and part of the introductory curriculum involves using the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">turtle</a> module to program virtual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(robot)">turtle robots</a> to move around the screen and draw shapes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle graphics</a> have long been a popular educational tool to get students interested in programming (which is why they're included in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">Python Standard Library</a>). They're cool to work with, they can create pretty pictures, and they provide a lot of visual feedback to help students to tie their program to a physical result in a way that pure text programs do not. They even have a connection to my favorite thing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">fractals</a>, via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence#Fractals_and_turtle_graphics">Thue-Morse sequence</a>.</p>

	<p>But the built-in turtle objects in Python can't shoot missiles at each other, so I fixed that.</p>
	
	<h2>Technical Difficultues</h2>
	
	<p>My original intention was to extend the built-in turtle class to include a variety of gameplay-related methods for the player to use in their custom AI modules. In order to properly define the AI's behavior I opted for a discretized time scale so that the player could define, at any given moment, what their turtle should do in the next step. It turns out that the built-in module has a lot of overhead that led to a lot of slowdown while attempting to execute many step events per second, and so I ended up having to program my own turtle module from scratch.</p>
	
	<p>Lacking access to the graphical capabilities of the built-in turtle class, I used <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a> to create the game window and all of the in-game graphics. In order to make the module as portable as possible I wanted to stick to using <i>only</i> modules from the Python Standard Library, which resulted in a few more challenges to work around. As far as I can tell there is no built-in command for rotating sprites in Tkinter, so it was not an option to include an image folder for all of the different turtle shapes. As a result I ended up defining all of the different turtle shapes as polygons, vertex-by-vertex, with the coordinates being translated and rotated between each step in order for the image to rotate with the turtle's heading.</p>
