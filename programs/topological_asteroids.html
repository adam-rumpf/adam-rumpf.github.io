	<p>This project was largely inspired by the freeware program <a href="www.geometrygames.org/TorusGames/index.html">Torus Games</a>, by Jeff Weeks. Jeff has <a href="www.geometrygames.org">an entire website</a> devoted to interesting games and other interactive programs to illustrate abstract mathematical concepts, and anyone who knows me knows that I'm all about that. This particular program was made to allow players to explore how familiar games work differently when space connects to itself differently. Whereas most board games that we are used to have finite boundaries, on a torus the edges "wrap around", and things that leave through one edge seem to reappear at the other edge.</p>
	
	<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus">torus</a> is one of the simplest topological spaces to understand (outside of the disk and the Euclidean plane). It is also fairly easy to program around, since in general it just requires resetting the coordinates of an object that moves off of the screen so that it reappears at the other side. The 1979 Atari arcade game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)"><i>Asteroids</i></a> takes place on a torus, with the player controlling a ship trying to avoid and destroy asteroids. Both the player's ship and the asteroids that appear wrap around from one side of the screen to the other, requiring the player to develop an intuitive understanding of the game's space in order to effectively play.</p>
	
	<p>My goal with this project was to use the game of <i>Asteroids</i> to explore some more exotic topological spaces. One useful way of describing how a topological surface connects to itself is through use of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_polygon">fundamental polygon</a>. In the case of the torus, we can draw this as a parallelogram whose opposite sides are identified with each other, like in the following picture:</p>
	
	<p class="center"><img src="images/asteroids/polygon_torus.png" alt="Torus" width="200px"/></p>
	
	<p>In this picture, edges with the same color are meant to represent the same points in space. For example, the left and right sides of the square are both red, meaning that an object located at the left edge of the square is, somehow, also simultaneously located at the right edge of the square. This is because the torus "wraps around" to meet itself. If you travel far enough in a straight line on a torus you will eventually end up back where you started. Likewise, the top and bottom edges also represent the same set of points.</p>
	
	<p>There are a couple of different ways to interpret the fundamental polygon. One is to imagine that the polygon represents the entire 2D space, by itself, and that a person living on the torus whom walked off of one edge would suddenly warp to the other edge, as if going through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)">portal</a>. From that person's perspective, though, everything would appear to be continuous, and there would be no way to tell where the boundaries of the polygon were. In fact, if they were to look towards the right side of the polygon, they would see the back of their own head, since some of the light reflecting off of them would travel to the left to wrap around and meet their own eye. In this way we can think of the fundamental polygon as being something that we can tile infinitely many copies of to fill all of 2D space, as in the following picture:</p>
	
	<p class="center"><img src="images/asteroids/polygon_cylinder_tile.png" alt="Cylinder" width="600px"/></p>
	
	<p>Because of the way that the torus connects to itself, it can be thought of as repeating itself infinitely in two different directions. The one-directional version of this would be the cylinder, whose fundamental polygon looks like this:</p>
	
	<p class="center"><img src="images/asteroids/polygon_cylinder.png" alt="Cylinder" width="200px"/></p>
	
	<p>Like the torus, the cylinder also wraps around to meet itself. Unlike the torus, the cylinder has two edges representing a boundary that cannot be crossed while still remaining on the surface. We can easily imagine creating a model cylinder by taking a square of paper, curling it into a loop, and gluing the opposite edges together. If we could somehow bend the paper to then also glue the <i>other</i> set of opposite edges together, we would get a doughnut-shaped torus.</p>
	
	<p>The way in which the torus and the cylinder identify coordinates with each other represents only a geometric translation, meaning that objects that leave one edge reappear at the opposite edge in the same orientation. There are more complicated spaces for which this is not the case, for example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip">Möbius strip</a>, whose fundamental polygon is:</p>
	
	<p class="center"><img src="images/asteroids/polygon_mobius.png" alt="Möbius Strip" width="200px"/></p>
	
	<p>A Möbius strip can easily be modeled by taking a strip of paper, giving it a half-twist, and then gluing the opposite ends together. Like the cylinder this identifies one set of opposite sides with each other, but unlike the cylinder this half-twist results in the orientation reversing, as indicated in the polygon by the direction of the arrows reversing.</p>
